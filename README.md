This is my take on the shopify intern challenge, you will need to use npm start to run, and you can only run it after setting "shopifyinternchallenge" as your current directory if you wish to run it without the link it is running on.

From the previous year when this was submited, i've expanded upon it by overhauling the stucture of the code, improving my design, and added a few features such as a favourites tab, a filtering system and, more notably, an infinite loading mechanism to retreive nasa data dynamically as the user scrolls down, rather than just just retreiving all data from the past month

It is being hosted with the following link: https://michascant.github.io/Internship-Shopify-Challenge/
